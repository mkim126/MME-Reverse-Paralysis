# This is after explaining to a friend and talking to her about the topic

	these are research that has been
	done that is similar to the Reverse
	paralysis; haven't researched too
	much on it yet.

	[1]Electrical stimulation to the brain to send
	neurotransmitters to your leg to force your brain

  	Deep brain stimulation:

	*"It is a new and improved variation of an old surgery(involved destroying small parts of the brain within structures called the thalamus or globus pallidus)"*

	It is a surgical option for patients who have Parkinson's disease, Essential Tremor, dystonia, and tremor due to multiple sclerosis.
	An electrode is implanted in the brain. This then creates a pulse of energy to block the abnormal activity in the brain.

	Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: magnetic coil- magnetic waves
	This process basically uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. It is noninvasive
		An electromagnetic soil is placed on the scalp near the forehead.
		This then would deliver magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells in the brain that controls mood. It activates regions of the brain that have decreased activity.
			It is said that is seems to ease depression symptoms and improve mood.
		There are some side effects such as a headache, scalp discomfort where the stimulation was performed, tingling and spasms of facial muscles, and lightheadedness
		The sessions are generally five times a week for four to six weeks.

OPTOGENETICS
  Nancy Kanwisher- one of the first people to use fMRI
  Prosopagnosia: sudden loss of ability to recognize faces brain comprises general-purpose machinery as well as more specialized components.
  fMRI and electrical stimulation allowed Kanwisher's team to establish which part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process many specialized areas in the brain can be identified.

 Optogenetics is a biological technique which involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels.
 			basically controlling the brain with light
					 technique in neuroscience in which genes for light-sensitive proteins are introduced into specific types of brain cells in order to monitor and control their activity precisely using light signals.
