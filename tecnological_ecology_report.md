Not only for just but reverse paralysis, but scientists are predicting a huge step forward for brain implants in general.
Human interaction will change big time, just as smart phone has changed the way we interact with each other today. For now, Reverse Paralysis seems to only be an option for people who can afford it(so basically an higher class). It costs almost over 800,000 dollars. There's also a lot of training that goes into the process even after the procedure. It took one man 1 year to just eat by himself after the procedure was done. The time in between to train your brain is long and requires money.

In the beginning just as getting smartphones might've been difficult in the beginning due to the cost, it will soon become universal with the brain implants(This is what scientists think might happen). Although I think that there is still a lot of time that will be needed before this actually happens because there's still not enough information on how brain implants could actually work. Also there are worries that putting a brain implant into a perfectly normal brain could damage the entire brain as a whole. On the other hand, reverse paralysis is only directed to people with a spinal cord injury, so it will only help in aiding a person to walk again. Right now, it isn't really being used for anything besides that. Brain implants in general seem to be predicted to create an enormous change in the social norm. I think reverse paralysis can contribute to this. Since this brain implant is used to send signals from the brain to a nerve to move a certain body part, this can change the way humans will behave. They can also use this idea with robots, which could change the way our society functions as a whole.

I think brain implants in general are starting to come from the idea of computers or smartphones. I feel like scientists are trying to create a smartphone in our brains. This can completely change the way we interact with each other. Smart phones have already changed the way we interact with each other. People are predicting that soon we will only need to communicate with our minds online or just controlling our everyday objects such as a car with our minds. The crazier part is that they think this will also lead to our human communications to change to talking with thoughts. This evolution will also bring us closer to artificial intelligence. This could change the way our society could work as a whole in a way because we would have all this information through a chip in our brain. A lot of brain implants also kind of started from the idea of the reverse paralysis. The idea of being able to move a part of our body again using our brain shows the possibilities of what our brains could do.

"How, for instance, will a world with autonomous vehicles, with features like wireless charging and radar sensors, impact patients with brain implants or pacemakers? Or, in the more distant future, what if weâ€™re all walking around with implants that make us smarter, and treat our depression? How will this complex world of signals interplay then?""
