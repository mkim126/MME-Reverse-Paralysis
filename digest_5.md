"The Mutual Wave Machine (MWM) is an interactive neurofeedback installation and neuroscience experiment, that embodies the elusive notion of ‘being on the same wavelength’ with another person through brainwave synchronization. Enclosed by an intimate capsule and immersed in an audiovisual environment that responds and reflects their shared brain activity, two visitors can directly experience and manipulate their internal efforts to approach each other, or distance themselves from each other.
During the experience, greater brainwave synchronization is reflected in greater vividness and more coherent and recognizable audiovisual patterns, while lack of synchronization strays towards dark audio-visual chaos: a faint ringing in the ears and static in the retinas.
The visualization of neural synchrony is supplemented by a direct audio translation of each participant’s individual brain activity, creating an evolving composition of volume changes and harmonies that hover at the often uncomfortable perceptual boundary between rhythm and pitch."
