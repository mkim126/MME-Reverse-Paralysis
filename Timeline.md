Brain Stimulation History

-1970s: New drug therapy for movement disorders introduced called levodopa
    the dosages could be adjusted to suit individual needs
    but soon it created movement control problems that were worse than the original symptoms

-1980s: stimulating the tissue with harmless pulses of electricity
    it could be localized so only certain parts of the brain could be affected

-1985: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation was invented

-1998: A patient first used a brain probe to move a computer cursor across a screen(technologyreview.com)

-2002: DBS (an implantable deep brain stimulation)
    This allowed electrical stimulation to specifically target only the brain region closest to where the electrode is planted.

    Then a *pulse generator* is used to generate the electrical signals that are sent to the electrodes
      This is placed under the skin near the chest(includes a battery with a lifespan of 2-7 years)
    *extension* is the last component(an insulated cable that carries the electrical signals from the pulse generator to the electrode planted in the brain)

-2005: Optogenetics began to come together, but I think they started looking for methods in 1999

-currently: Reverse Paralysis(around 2014-now)
