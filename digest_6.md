#Brain Implant Could End Paralysis for Some Sufferers
https://www.techradar.com/news/brain-implant-could-end-paralysis-for-some-sufferers

-World Health Organisation: every year 250,000-500,000 people suffer spinal cord injuries
  This leaves them with some form of long term damage
-World Heart Federation: Five million people are left paralyzed by stroke per year
SCIENCE OF HOW OUR BODY WORKS
-When we want to pick up an object: impulses are sent from your hand to nervous system in a fraction of a second
  it is able to tell how heavy, how fragile, temperature, and texture
  This is AKA AFFERENT SIGNALS
  Meaning: the brain needs to know how much for is needed to pick it up, the right grip strength, and how long you can hold it for, and how easy it will be to hold it
  The brain will then send signals back to your nervous system to the muscles to pick up the object AKA EFFERENT SIGNALS
SOO the brain chip must be able to work with both the AFFERENT and EFFERENT signals
"When you see demonstrations of robots being wildly inappropriate in the amount of force they use, it's usually because they only have the equivalent of efferent signals. This is one of the main hindrances of using an external system, like a robotic brace, to overcome paralysis."
There is also a growing field of work to treat Parkinson's treatment which also includes brain implants.

#Why People with Brain Implants are Afraid to go Through Automatic Doors

THE STORY
"In 2009, Gary Olhoeft walked into a Best Buy to buy some DVDs. He walked out with his whole body twitching and convulsing. Olhoeft has a brain implant, tiny bits of microelectronic circuitry that deliver electrical impulses to his motor cortex in order to control the debilitating tremors he suffers as a symptom of Parkinson’s disease. It had been working fine. So, what happened when he passed through those double wide doors into consumer electronics paradise? He thinks the theft-prevention system interfered with his implant and turned it off."
-These kinds of conflicts could be happening because the variety of signals we have in the world. Since brain implants revolve around the idea of working with signals, this can cause disastrous effects on the people using them.
-Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database: over the past five years-374 cases where electromagnetic interference was reportedly a factor in an injury involving medical devices including neural implants, pacemakers and insulin pumps.
  Problem occurred with airport security, using massagers, or just being near electrical sources.
Olhoeft(retired professor of geophysics in Colorado) said "His implant, he says, operated at the same electromagnetic frequency as Best Buy’s theft detection system, and the two signals interfered with each other."
"In its manuals, Medtronic, the maker of the device, clearly advises patients that things like hairdryers, cell phones, power tools, and yes, in-store security systems may impact devices. The patient manual for Medtronic’s deep brain stimulation devices has an entire appendix to potential sources of EMI, and the consequences for not heeding these warnings that it lists are dire: system changes, changes to stimulation, injury or even death."
