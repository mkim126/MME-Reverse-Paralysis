# Bias Report

  For the specifics of brain implants in terms of Reverse Paralysis. This is specifically biased towards spinal injuries only for now. It is currently not being used to help with any other injuries.

  For brain implants in general, there are many different biases that come into play.

  1. Brain implants are biased to only people who know of them.
      A study showed that brain implants are capable of doing many different things in the future, whether it is to think more like Albert Einstein or to beat the robots. It also showed that people who were more aware of this fact, felt more inclined to have a brain implant. On the other hand, people who didn't know about this technology felt more worried/less inclined to get the brain implant.
  2. Brain implants could be dangerous to healthy brains.
      In movies, society strived to create a technology like brain implants for the future of the people. In an article, it stated that it is most likely that this technology is actually starting to arise. The question was brought up on whether this is really safe for everyone because the process requires the brain to be exposed to a procedure that could possibly damage it as well. This could mean that brain implants might only work with brains that have a problem/in a need for an implant.
  3. Brain implants are biased toward people with low religious commitment.
      A study showed that 62% of people who had low religious commitment were twice more likely to get a brain implant, while on the other hand, people with high religious commitment which was about 30%, were only willing to do it. This is due to the idea that they believe that using a brain implant would meddle with the nature of things and they just find this technology to be morally unacceptable.
  4. Brain implants are more directed to the younger people
      In a study, they showed that adults are more against having brain implants. They believe that there will be more downsides than benefits for the society as a whole. I also think that as a younger child, the idea of having a brain implant that will help you to see the world in a different light would seem cool, so they would feel more inclined to get one.
  5. Brain implants are biased to criminals or people with addictions.
      There were many articles discussing the idea of how scientists want to use brain implants as a way of curing addiction or changing the minds of the way criminals think.
