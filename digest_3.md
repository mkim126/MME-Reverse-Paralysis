    "'Miracle' implant reverses paralysis"(The Sun[England])
        In this article, Rob Summers who was told he would be in a wheelchair
        for the rest of his life was given hope with a:
        BATTERY-POWERED ELECTRONIC IMPLANT at the base of his spine.
          This sends currents through the spinal cord to mimic brain signals
          that initiate movement

    My thoughts:
    Is this a real piece or satirical piece?
    If it is battery-powered, what happens when the battery runs out?
    I was also wondering what the time period of all this is. I would like to know how long it took for him to be able to move a little. I would also like to know what else went into the whole procedure, like what happens after the implant is placed.

    "Research Offers hope to Reverse Paralysis"
    (Windsor Star-Ontario) May 26,2011
    Dr. W. Giffordjones
    -Dr. Rochkind from Israel who is a neurosurgeon at the Tel Aviv University Sourasky Medical Center said that spinal injuries lead to total paralysis.
    -The steps to recover movement was to
      1. Bridge the gap between the severed nerve
      2. To nourish the nerve and stimulate its growth.
      3. To encourage the first step to move
    -One implant involved human spinal cord cells
    -The major advance was when he discovered it was possible to take cells from the lining of the adult human nose.
    -It is still unsure but, atm the tissue that is used in the implant is a mix of hyaluronic acid, neural growth factor, antioxidants(Vitamin C and etc.)
    -It is then placed in a biodegradable tube that will be placed between the severed nerve endings.
    -Researchers in Israel are also trying to use stem cells to produce dopamine.
      This is the substance that patients with Parkinson's Disease are lacking. They will also try to use it to help failing hearts.
    -Some nerve injuries aren't caused by the spinal cords
      One example that was given was the peripheral nerves being damaged for the legs and arms: He uses laser phototheraphy(this provides an immediate protective effect.) It also prevent muscle loss and helps to regenerate nerves leading to a restoration of muscle mass.
      This is done for 21 days(2 hours everyday)

    More info on the phototheraphy:
    How it is done?:
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on 18 patients who were randomly assigned placebo (non-active light: diffused LED lamp) or low-power laser irradiation (wavelength, 780 nm; power, 250 mW). Twenty-one consecutive daily sessions of laser or placebo irradiation were applied transcutaneously for 3 h to the injured peripheral nerve (energy density, 450 J/mm(2)) and for 2 h to the corresponding segments of the spinal cord (energy density, 300 J/mm(2)). Clinical and electrophysiological assessments were done at baseline, at the end of the 21 days of treatment, and 3 and 6 months thereafter.
    What are the results?:
      The laser-irradiated and placebo groups were in clinically similar conditions at baseline. The analysis of motor function during the 6-month follow-up period compared to baseline showed statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in the laser-treated group compared to the placebo group. No statistically significant difference was found in sensory function. Electrophysiological analysis also showed statistically significant improvement in recruitment of voluntary muscle activity in the laser-irradiated group (p = 0.006), compared to the placebo group.
    This pilot study suggests that in patients with long-term peripheral nerve injury noninvasive 780-nm laser phototherapy can progressively improve nerve function, which leads to significant functional recovery.

    My thoughts
      I think that it's amazing that Dr. Rochkind was able to find different methods to not only find solutions for spinal cord injuries, but also other nerve damaging injuries. I'm wondering when the final result for the type of tissue that will be put in the implant will consist of.
